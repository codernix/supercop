SUPERCOP Mirror
This repository is a mirror of the SUPERCOP (System for Unified Performance Evaluation of Cryptographic Operations) benchmarking toolkit by D. J. Bernstein and others.

Purpose
The official SUPERCOP bundle is distributed as a .tar.gz archive from the official website. This GitHub repository was created by Abou-Bakr Seddik Ouahabi to make the toolkit more accessible and easier to use for developers who prefer working with Git.

This is a vanilla, unmodified version of the software suite. It includes a wide range of cryptographic implementations from various authors, including portions adapted from TweetNaCl by Bernstein, Janssen, Lange, and Schwabe.

Official Source
The original software package can be downloaded from the official SUPERCOP webpage:
